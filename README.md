The Minecraft RAM Calculator is an npm package that simplifies the process of determining how much RAM is required for your Minecraft server, based on various server and player-related factors. This tool helps server administrators optimize their server's performance by ensuring they allocate the appropriate amount of memory.

## Features

- Easy-to-use JavaScript library for calculating required RAM.
- Supports various Minecraft server configurations and player counts.
- Provides recommendations for optimal RAM allocation.
- Helps prevent server lag and crashes due to insufficient memory.

## Installation

You can install the Minecraft RAM Calculator package via npm:

```bash
npm install minecraft-ram-calculator
```

## Usage

```javascript
const mrc = require('minecraft-ram-calculator');

// Example usage:
const maxPlayersPerInstance = 8; // Set the maximum players on the instance
const maxInstances = 7; // Set your maximum instances here.

const numPlayers = 100; // The number of players on your server
const ramNeeded = mrc(numPlayers, maxPlayersPerInstance, maxInstances);
console.log(`For ${numPlayers} players, you need ${ramNeeded.ramNeeded} GB RAM.`);
console.log(`This will use ${ramNeeded.instances} instances, leaving ${ramNeeded.playersLeftOut} players left out.`);
```

### Instances

You will have to define the max players you want in every instance. For example, as bedwars solos have the limit of 8 players, this value will be 8.
If you don't want to have a limit, set this to a very high number like 1000000.

The max instances is to limit the amount of instances to save computing power. You can do the same if you don't want a limit.

## Configuration

You can customize the `serverProperties` object to match your server's specific settings. The `calculateRAM` function will take these properties into account when making its recommendation.
